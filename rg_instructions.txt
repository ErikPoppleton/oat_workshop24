How to RG:

SHOW THE STRUCTURE FIRST!!!!!!!!!

1. Copy oxDNA/analysis/src/oxDNA_analysis_tools/skeleton.py
2. Look up the formula for rg

    Rg^2 = sum([r^2 for r in radiuses])/n

(3). Delete "arrrrrg" and all the places "optional_argument"/"flag1" appears
4. Make the compute function work

    confs = get_confs(ctx.top_info, ctx.traj_info, chunk_id*chunk_size, chunk_size)     # Show what a configuration is by importing it and looking at the docstring
    poses = np.array([inbox(c).positions for c in confs])                               # Have to import inbox
    com = np.mean(poses, axis=1, keepdims=True)                                         # If people question this, add prints to each thing to show the shapes
    dists = np.linalg.norm(poses-com, axis=2)
    sq_dists = np.power(dists, 2)
    msd = np.sum(sq_dists, axis=1)/ctx.top_info.nbases
    rg = np.sqrt(msd)
    return(rg)

5. Change the default output file name, program name, program description, etc
6. Change the output file to be a op.json file
    from json import dump

    outfile = "rg.json"

    out_obj = {"rg" : [o for o in out]}
    dump(out_obj, f)
7. Install oat and see that it works
