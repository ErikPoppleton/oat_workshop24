# oxDNA Analysis Tools Workshop

In this workshop we demonstrate how to create a new script in oxDNA Analysis Tools (oat).

Introductory material regarding how oat works and some important details on files can be found in the PowerPoint presentation.

rg_instructions.txt explains the changes that need to be made to skeleton.py to turn it into a radius of gyration script.

We use an example of a short simulation of an [RNA tile](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/7PTS) melting at 99C as an example where calculating rg might be useful.
